        <h3>BH&M Environmental Consultants, Inc, <span>Memphis, TN</span><span class="title"> - Technical Writer/Inspector</span></h3>
          <h5>May 2016-September 2019</h5>
            <p>During my time at BH&M, I’ve primarily worked as a writer and editor. Over time, however, I became a state certified lead and asbestos inspector as well, so I would often see projects through from the beginning with field work, to the end through writing documents required by our clients and the Tennessee Health Department. I was also tasked with many other projects such as taking company photos and redesigning the company website.</p>
